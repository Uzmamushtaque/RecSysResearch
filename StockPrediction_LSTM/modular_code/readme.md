## **Project Overview**

Stock price prediction plays a crucial role in financial markets, and accurate forecasts can have significant implications for businesses, investors, and financial institutions. 

Stock price prediction helps investors and fund managers make informed investment decisions. By accurately forecasting future stock prices, investors can identify potential opportunities for maximizing profits or minimizing losses. It enables them to allocate their capital wisely and adjust their investment portfolios based on predicted price movements.

Machine and Deep Learning have demonstrated their potential to enhance stock price prediction accuracy and assist investors, traders, and financial analysts in making informed decisions. By leveraging ML techniques, businesses can gain valuable insights, optimize investment strategies, and improve risk management in stock market's complex and dynamic realm.

The prediction of stock prices is a challenging task due to the inherent complexity and volatility of financial markets. Traditional methods often fail to capture the intricate patterns and dependencies present in stock price data. However, RNN and LSTM models have shown great potential in capturing temporal dependencies and making accurate predictions in various time series forecasting tasks.


In this first project of our four-part series, we will focus on implementing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks specifically for the task of stock price prediction. This project serves as an essential foundation for understanding and utilizing these advanced deep learning techniques in the context of financial forecasting.

Throughout this project, we will delve into the fundamentals of RNNs and LSTMs and explore their suitability for capturing temporal dependencies in stock price data. We will learn how to preprocess and prepare the historical stock price dataset for training and testing our models.

## **Execution Instructions**
<br>
 
### Option 1: Running on your computer locally
 
To run the notebook on your local system set up a [python](https://www.python.org/) environment. Set up the [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) with python or by using [anaconda distribution](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/jupyter). Download the notebook and open a jupyter notebook to run the code on local system.
 
The notebook can also be executed by using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

**Python Version: 3.8.10**

* Create a python environment using the command 'python3 -m venv myenv'.

* Activate the environment by running the command 'myenv\Scripts\activate.bat'.

* Install the requirements using the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

* Run engine.py with the command 'python3 engine.py'.
 

 
### Option 2: Executing with Colab
Colab, or "Collaboratory", allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with access to GPUs free of charge and easy sharing.
 
You can run the code using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) by uploading the ipython notebook.
